# BLE Mesh Testing with Xiao Seeed nRF52840

## Overview
This project is designed to test Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Mesh functionality using the Xiao Seeed nRF52840 development board. It leverages the Nordic Semiconductor's nRF Connect SDK (version 2.9.1) to implement and evaluate mesh networking capabilities.
⚠️ **Note:** This project is in an early testing phase. Features and functionality are subject to change and may not be fully working at this moment.

## Features (still working on)
- BLE Mesh provisioning and communication
- Node configuration and message relaying
- Basic mesh models (e.g., Generic OnOff)
- Logging and debugging support

## Hardware Requirements
- Xiao Seeed nRF52840 board
- USB cable for flashing and power
- Optional: Additional BLE Mesh nodes for testing

## Software Requirements
- [nRF Connect SDK 2.9.1](https://developer.nordicsemi.com/nRF_Connect_SDK/doc/2oducts/Development-tools/nRF-Commandallation
